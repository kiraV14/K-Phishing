# K-Phishing

Project Name: K-Phishing - Interactive Login

General Description:
The Kira Tools project is a simple web application using Flask that allows users to choose between two login pages (Facebook and Instagram) through the command line in Python. The application collects login data and redirects the user to the chosen platform based on the options the user selects in the terminal.

Features:

Interactive interface in the terminal: The user chooses between logging in to Facebook or Instagram using the colored instructions in the terminal.
Secure data storage: The login data (email and password) is saved in a local text file for experimentation.
Dynamic routing: The user is redirected to the correct page based on their selection.
Interactive messages and colors: The colorama library was used to add colors that make the messages more attractive and easy to read.
Technologies used:

Python (Flask, Colorama)
HTML (for templates)
Interactive environment via the command line
os library to handle environmental variables
Running:

Make sure to install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file.
Run the app using the python app.py command.

When run, you will be presented with options to choose between logging into Facebook or Instagram directly from the command line.

Note: The project is best used for learning and experimentation only; please do not use it to store sensitive data.
